# Background Generator Version 2

This is a simple website that allows a user to create a gradient background by choosing 2 colors - alternatively, the user can click the "random" button to have 2 random colors generated. Once a new background is generated, the website displays the CSS attribute to recreate the gradient with RGB colors. 

This project requires the use of DOM manipulation to alter the display of the webpage and Javascript functions to take the color inputs and display the desired result.
